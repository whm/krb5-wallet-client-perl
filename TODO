 * Use the remctl perl support to execute remctl commands instead of
   shelling out to the command line.
 * Current keytab downloads are treated the same as file downloads in
   that they complete replace the target file.  For keytab downloads
   the keytab should be added to the existing keytab file.
 * The current package is Debian specific.  An upstream branch that
   is suitable for uploading to CPAN should be created.

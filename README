DESCRIPTION

  The wallet is a system for managing secure data.  The wallet client
  that is part of the krb5-wallet package is written in C.  Since
  krb5-wallet is not available on all architectures the client is not
  available for many systems.  This wallet client is a pure Perl
  implementation of a wallet client and is available for any system
  that supports perl and remctl-client.

  This wallet client is a subset of the functionality available with
  the C client.  Notably it overwrites keytab files when downloading
  a keytab instead of adding the keytab to the existing keytab file.
